##  So, what is AngularJS?

note:
- A JavaScript framework that extends HTML, teaches the browser new syntax
- What HTML would be like if it was designed for building applications
- Built with testing in mind!
- It is opinionated, but aims for thos eopinions to be a starting point rather
  than law
- Frees you from: 
    - manipulating the DOM programatically
    - registering callback
    - marshalling data to and from the UI
    - writing tons of initialisation code just to get started
