note:
    - The most important thing we do is talk to users
    - Have become almost religious in our efforts
    - This picture is from a day Ingrid has at UiO where we bought coffee in exchange for testers
    - The most prominent button we have is the feedback button
    - We answer all feedback mail with a personal answer, everyone in the team reads and contributes
    - We try to follow that model as long as we are able to
