##  One week "sprints"

####Do rather than plan

note:
    - Because everything is moving so fast, we need to have an hour long
      planning session every monday
    - Mostly to get our bearings
    - We follow a principle of do rather than plan
    - You can't think of everything before you start implementing
    - It's often quicker to prototype it live, than spend weeks planning
    - We roll everything out in production, also not yet completed features
      (behind flags)
