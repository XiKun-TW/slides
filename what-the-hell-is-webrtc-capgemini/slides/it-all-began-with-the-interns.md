<h2 style="margin-top: 50%">It all began with the interns</h2>

note:
    - So, our story actually begins with the interns
    - After doing RTC for a long time in another project, we found WebRTC
    - Prompted a master thesis done by Thomas Bruun (also working on appear.in)
    - Got the idea to test it out for a summer project
    - 2 weeks later they had a working demo
    - Most of the grown ups were away, decided to productify it
    - appear.in was born
